This IMDB api is built using GraphQL (docs: https://graphql.org/learn/)
To install all the dependencies run npm install command to download all the dependencies
In the browser go to http://localhost:4000/grapgql port, this will open Apollo grapgql snadbox for testing the queries
In real world examples the .env file is not pushed onto the github repository, but this is just a test so I have pushed it to my github repository
